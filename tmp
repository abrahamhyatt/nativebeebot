<item><title>Bumble Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) of Montana</title><description><p>Montana supports a diverse assemblage of bumble bees (<i>Bombus</i> Latreille) due to its size, landscape diversity, and location at the junction of known geographic ranges of North American species. We compiled the first inventory of <i>Bombus</i> species in Montana, using records from 25 natural history collections and labs engaged in bee research, collected over the past 125 years, as well as specimens collected specifically for this project during the summer of 2015. Over 12,000 records are included, with 28 species of <i>Bombus</i> now confirmed in the state. Based on information from nearby regions, four additional species are predicted to occur in Montana. Of the 28 species, <i>Bombus bimaculatus</i> Cresson and <i>Bombus borealis</i> Kirby are new state records. The presence of <i>B. borealis</i> was previously predicted, but the presence of <i>B. bimaculatus</i> in Montana represents a substantial extension of its previously reported range. Four additional "eastern" bumble bee species are recorded from the state, and three species pairs thought to replace one another from the eastern to western United States are now known to be sympatric in Montana. Additionally, our data are consistent with reported declines in populations of <i>Bombus occidentalis</i> Greene and <i>Bombus suckleyi</i> Greene, highlighting a need for targeted surveys of these two species in Montana.</p></description><link>http://aesa.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/saw064v1?rss=1</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2016 21:16:38 -0800</pubDate><guid>http://aesa.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/saw064v1?rss=1</guid></item>

<item><title>The adverse impact of the neonicotinoid seed treatment ban on crop protection in oilseed rape in the UK</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para" id="ps4511-para-0001">
<p>This paper describes the consequences of the ban on neonicotinoid seed treatments on pest management in oilseed rape. Since the ban was implemented in December 2013, there have been serious crop losses in 2014, 2015 and 2016 due to cabbage stem flea beetles, <i>Psylliodes chrysocephala,</i> and aphids, <i>Myzus persicae,</i> which have developed resistance to the alternative pyrethroid sprays that were employed to control them. This has resulted in increased crop losses, decreased yields, and a substantial decrease in the area grown, leading to fewer flowering crops available in the spring, especially in the eastern region of the UK. This is likely to have an adverse effect on bees locally.</p>

<item><title>Is non-host pollen suitable for generalist bumblebees?</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Current evidence suggests that pollen is both chemically and structurally protected. Despite increasing interest in studying bee–flower networks, the constraints for bee development related to pollen nutritional content, toxicity and digestibility as well as their role in the shaping of bee–flower interactions have been poorly studied. In this study we combined bioassays of the generalist bee <em>Bombus terrestris</em> on pollen of <em>Cirsium</em>, <em>Trifolium</em>, <em>Salix</em>, and <em>Cistus</em> genera with an assessment of nutritional content, toxicity, and digestibility of pollen. Microcolonies showed significant differences in their development, non-host pollen of <em>Cirsium</em> being the most unfavorable. This pollen was characterized by the presence of quite rare δ7-sterols and a low digestibility. <em>Cirsium</em> consumption seemed increase syrup collection, which is probably related to a detoxification mixing behavior. These results strongly suggest that pollen traits may act as drivers of plant selection by bees and partly explain why Asteraceae pollen is rare in bee generalist diet.</p>

<item><title>Seasonality of salt foraging in honey bees (Apis mellifera)</title><description><div class="para" id="een12375-para-0001">
<p>1. Honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) prefer foraging at compound-rich, ‘dirty’, water sources over clean water sources. As a honey bee's main floral diet only contains trace amounts of micronutrients&#160;–&#160;likely not enough to sustain an entire colony&#160;–&#160;it was hypothesised that honey bees forage in dirty water for physiologically essential minerals that their floral diet, and thus the colony, may lack.</p>
</div>
<div class="para">
<p>2. While there are many studies regarding macronutrient requirements of honey bees, few investigate micronutrient needs. For this study, from 2013 to 2015, a series of preference assays were conducted in both summer and autumn.</p>
</div>
<div class="para">
<p>3. During all field seasons, honey bees exhibited a strong preference for sodium in comparison to deionised water. There was, however, a notable switch in preferences for other minerals between seasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="para">
<p>4. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium&#160;–&#160;three minerals most commonly found in pollen&#160;–&#160;were preferred in autumn when pollen was scarce, but were avoided in summer when pollen was abundant. Thus, as floral resources change in distribution and abundance, honey bees similarly change their water-foraging preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="para">
<p>5. Our data suggest that, although they are generalists with relatively few gustatory receptor genes, honey bee foragers are fine-tuned to search for micronutrients. This ability likely helps the foragers in their search for a balanced diet for the colony as a whole.</p>

<item><title>Methoprene does not affect juvenile hormone titers in honey bee (Apis mellifera) workers</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Methoprene, a juvenile hormone (JH) analog, is a widely used insecticide that also accelerates behavioral development in honey bees (<em>Apis mellifera</em>). JH regulates the transition from nursing to foraging in adult worker bees, and treatment with JH or methoprene have both been shown to induce precocious foraging. To determine how methoprene changes honey bee behavior, we compared JH titers of methoprene-treated and untreated bees. Behavioral observations confirmed that methoprene treatment significantly increased the number of precocious foragers in 3 out of 4 colonies. In only 1 out of 4 colonies, however, was there a significant difference in JH titers between the methoprene-treated and control bees. Further, in all 4 colonies, there was no significant differences in JH titers between precocious and normal-aged foragers. These results suggest that methoprene did not directly affect the endogenous JH secreted by <em>corpora allata</em>. Because methoprene caused early foraging without changing workers’ JH titers, we conclude that methoprene most likely acts directly on the JH receptors as a substitute for JH.</p>

<div class="section" id="ps4449-sec-0001">
<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
<div class="para" id="ps4449-para-0007">
<p>Neonicotinoid insecticides have been identified as an important factor contributing to bee diversity declines. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on <i>Apis mellifera</i> and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (<i>A. mellifera</i>, <i>Bombus terrestris</i>, <i>Osmia bicornis</i>) following oral exposure in the laboratory.</p>

<div class="section" id="ps4449-sec-0002">
<h4>RESULTS</h4>
<div class="para" id="ps4449-para-0008">
<p>We developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed-coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non-lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective LD<sub>10</sub> of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in <i>A. mellifera</i> (4 and 24 h) and <i>B. terrestris</i> (4 h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96 h) in <i>O. bicornis</i>. <i>O. bicornis</i> was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin.</p>

<item><title>A beekeepers perspective on the neonicotinoid ban.</title><description><h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para" id="ps4489-para-0001">
<p>Bees and agrochemicals have a long history. For example the first volume of IBRA’s journal <i>Bee World</i> in 1919 contains mention of poisoning of bees by spraying an orchard with lead arsenate. Being insects, it is self-evident that the use of insecticides to control crop pests poses a risk to bees. Bee poisoning incidents became a very serious problem in the 1960s and 1970s with spraying of, in particular, oilseed rape with organophosphorus compounds. The introduction of carbamates and then especially synthetic pyrethroids reduced these problems. Data from the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme show that in recent years there have been very few poisoning incidents in the UK that can be attributed to agricultural insecticides. The introduction of neonicotinoid insecticides has, however, been very controversial. Almost as soon as they were introduced in the 1990s, French beekeepers blamed colony losses on imidacloprid used on sunflowers and maize, but restrictions on its use did not lead to a reduction in losses or a to a reduction in beekeepers concerns. Acute pesticide poisoning incidents by neonicotinoids in Germany and Italy in 2008 further sealed their reputation. Despite laboratory evidence showing their harm, field experience remains equivocal, and many commercial beekeepers continue to move their colonies to oilseed rape crops for honey production. The neonicotinoid moratorium has undoubtedly led to the increased use of older insecticides, and the effect of this on bee populations is unknown and unquantified. Many beekeepers are currently confused by the conflicting evidence.</p>

<item><title>Landscape spatial configuration is a key driver of wild bee demographics</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>The majority of studies investigating the effects of landscape composition and configuration on bee populations have been conducted in regions of intensive agricultural production, ignoring regions which are dominated by seminatural habitats, such as the islands of the Aegean Archipelago. In addition, research so far has focused on the landscape impacts on bees sampled in cropped fields while the landscape effects on bees inhabiting seminatural habitats are understudied. Here, we investigate the impact of the landscape on wild bee assemblages in 66 phryganic (low scrubland) communities on 8 Aegean islands. We computed landscape metrics (total area and total perimeter–area ratio) in 4 concentric circles (250, 500, 750, and 1000 m) around the center of each bee sampling site including 3 habitat groups (namely phrygana, cultivated land, and natural forests). We further measured the local flower cover in 25 quadrats distributed randomly at the center of each sampling site. We found that the landscape scale is more important than the local scale in shaping abundance and species richness of bees. Furthermore, habitat configuration was more important than the total area of habitats, probably because it affects bees’ movement across the landscape. Phrygana and natural forests had a positive effect on bee demographics, while cultivated land had a negative effect. This demonstrates that phryganic specialists drive bee assemblages in these seminatural landscapes. This finding, together with the shown importance of landscape scale, should be considered for the management of wild bees with special emphasis placed on the spatial configuration of seminatural habitats.</p>

<div class="para">
<p>Although the gut microbial communities in adult bumblebees and their associated functionalities are widely studied, descriptive data on the larval gut microbiota are still limited. The gut microbiota of a fully sampled wild <em>Bombus pascuorum</em> nest has been characterized, using the multiplexed Illumina MiSeq 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing technique. The nesters and foragers inhabiting the same nest showed the typical core bacterial sequences and only marginal differences in their characterized gut microbiota. The gut microbial communities within the adult and larval specimens differed strongly, as the typical core gut bacteria in the adult bumblebees are absent in the larval bumblebees. The bacterial communities within the larval gut are dominated by bacterial phylotypes of <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em> and <em>Lactobacillaceae</em>, supplemented with genera belonging to <em>Corynebacteriales</em> and <em>Bacillales</em>. The function of this larval gut microbiota, being different from the adult, remains to be determined.</p>

<item><title>Bumblebees depend on ericaceous species to survive in temperate heathlands</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<ol class="numbered" id="icad12201-list-0001">
<li>Bumblebees are the predominant wild pollinators for many plant species in temperate regions. A bumblebee colony requires pollen and nectar throughout its lifetime, but degraded and fragmented habitats may have gaps in the temporal and spatial continuity of floral resources.</li>
<li>Heathlands are open biotopes that provide favourable habitat for bumblebees like <em>Bombus jonellus</em>, a declining species in Belgium. In heathlands, ericaceous species are the main plants that provide pollen and nectar for bumblebees. Although the nectar composition of ericaceous species has been previously studied, data on pollen composition remain scarce.</li>
<li>We examined bumblebee diets (composition of their pollen loads) in Belgian heathlands over the course of a colony lifetime to assess the fidelity of bumblebees for ericaceous species. We compared nutritional values by investigating the chemical composition (amino acids, polypeptides and sterols) of the pollen of the ericaceous and dominant non-ericaceous species present in pollen loads. No relationship was detected between the abundance of a particular plant species in bumblebee loads and its pollen composition.</li>
<li>The successive flowering periods and the nutritional quality of pollen of ericaceous species offer valuable resources for bumblebees. Ericaceous species represent a large part of bumblebee diets in heathlands, especially in early spring and late summer when the diversity of other flowering species was low.</li>
<li>Bumblebee pollen loads also contained non-ericaceous flowering species that grow outside heathlands. Thus, land planning must incorporate conservation strategies for the different elements of the landscape matrix, including heathlands, peatlands, meadows and margins.</li>

In general, particles with a diameter smaller than 2.5 and 10 µm represent about 40 and 75% of the total dust mass respectively. The finest size fraction (&lt;1 µm) contains a higher content of active ingredient.

<item><title>Dependence of Asian honeybee on deciduous woody plants for pollen resource during spring to mid-summer in northern Japan</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p><em>Apis cerana japonica</em> Radoszkowski, endemic to Japan, is known to be one of the most important pollinators for wild plants and crops, such as buckwheat, in cool to warm temperate Japan. To determine the degree of dependence of <em>A. cerana japonica</em> on forest resources, we analyzed pollen brought back to nests in a typical “Satoyama” landscape with relatively high deciduous forest coverage in northern Japan. We divided the landscape elements of the study area into three types: deciduous forest, conifer plantation and open land according to landcover digital data, and each pollen taxon was assigned to one of these three types of landscape elements. We collected total pollen loads of 15.75 g (total of colonies A and B) in May (spring), 1.57 g (total of colonies A and C) in June (early summer), 19.03 g (total of colonies A, B and C) in July (mid-summer) and 45.61 g (total of colonies A, B and D) in September (autumn). Deciduous forests are the most important foraging habitats for <em>A. cerana japonica</em> in the “Satoyama” landscape especially from spring to mid-summer when mass flowering of tall trees and shrubs species provides rich floral resources for developing bee colonies. On the other hand, the bees frequently foraged from herbaceous plant species in autumn when flowering of tree species reduces and herbaceous plant species have flowering peaks. In turn, the bees provide pollination services to a number of wild flowers blooming in various forest layers ranging from the canopy to the understory layer.</p>

<item><title>The cephalic labial gland secretions of two socially parasitic bumblebees Bombus hyperboreus (alpinobombus) and Bombus inexspectatus (thoracobombus) question their inquiline strategy</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Socially parasitic Hymenoptera have evolved morphological, chemical, and behavioral adaptations to overcome the sophisticated recognition and defense systems of their social host to invade host nests and exploit their worker force. In bumblebees, social parasitism appeared in at least three subgenera independently: in the subgenus <em>Psithyrus</em> consisting entirely of parasitic species, in the subgenus <em>Alpinobombus</em> with <em>Bombus hyperboreus</em>, and in the subgenus <em>Thoracobombus</em> with <em>B. inexspectatus</em>. Cuckoo bumblebee males utilize species-specific cephalic labial gland secretions for mating purposes which have been showed as acting in their inquiline strategy. We performed cephalic labial gland secretions comparative analyses of <em>B. hyperboreus</em>, <em>B. inexspectatus</em> and their hosts. Males of both parasitic species exhibit high species specific levels of cephalic gland secretions, including different main compounds. Our results show no chemical mimicry in the cephalic gland secretions between inquilines and their host and we did not identify the repellent compounds already known in other cuckoo bumblebees.</p>

<item><title>Insect Visitors and Potential Pollinators of Orchis militaris (Orchidaceae) in Southern Belgium</title><description><p>As part of a research project on the food deception strategy in <i>Orchis militaris</i> (L.), the objective of this study was to identify insect visitors and potential pollinators of this orchid species in Belgium. In 2013, insects were collected over 2 d per site in five localities distributed in Southern Belgium (Wallonia). A total of 104 insects belonging to 49 species were caught. Dipterans were the most abundant visitors (50% of total specimens), followed by Hymenopterans (32%). <i>Rhingia campestris</i> Meigen, <i>Bombylius venosus</i> Mikan, <i>Apis mellifera</i> (L.), and <i>Bombus lapidarius</i> (L.) were the most abundant species. Only five specimens bore one to more than 10 pollinia: four honeybees (<i>A. mellifera</i>) and one bumblebee worker (<i>B. lapidarius</i>). These two species should be considered as potential pollinators in the study area, but probably not confirmed ones.</p></description><link>http://jinsectscience.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/16/1/104?rss=1</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2016 01:44:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://jinsectscience.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/16/1/104?rss=1</guid></item>
<item><title>Expression of key components of the RNAi machinery are suppressed in Apis mellifera that suffer a high virus infection</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Viruses are one of the major threats for honeybees and until now more than 20 different viruses have been discovered. Viruses and their hosts are engaged in a continuous arms race in which viral defense mechanisms drive the adaptive evolution of host immune genes, which in turn results in counter-adaptations of the viral immune antagonists. The honeybee immune responses to non-viral pathogens have been extensively studied, but little is known about the antiviral responses. Recent evidence suggests that the main mechanism of antiviral defense in insects is the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Furthermore, there is evidence that some viruses suppress this RNAi pathway in order to evade antiviral immunity. In the present study, we test this hypothesis by comparing the gene expression levels of some key components of the RNAi response of honeybees that were naturally infected with at least five viruses with those who were infected with only two or three viruses using a colorimetric microarray developed in-house, called BeeClinic, and subsequently confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our results show that key components of the RNAi pathway are indeed downregulated in highly infected bees. We were able to show that high virus loads suppress key RNAi components, which results in a counteraction of the host RNAi antiviral defense. As the RNAi is a primary defense against viruses, these findings shed new light on pathogen–host interactions and can help mitigate escalating colony losses worldwide.</p>

<item><title>Origins and implications of apid bees (Hymentopera: Apidae) in French Polynesia</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Island plant–pollinator networks are typically simpler than their continental counterparts and this can make them less resilient to disturbance from exotic species. French Polynesia has a very low diversity of bees, but their status as either native or introduced species has been largely speculative. We combine previous studies with new DNA sequence data to show that 11 bee species have now been recorded for French Polynesia. Haplotype variation at the ‘barcode’ region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome <em>c</em> oxidase subunit I (<em>COI</em>) for four of these species, <em>Ceratina dentipes</em> Freise, <em>Xylocopa sonorina</em> Smith, <em>Braunsapis puangensis</em> (Cockerell) and <em>Amegilla pulchra</em> (Smith), indicates that they all represent very recent introductions. <em>Apis mellifera</em> Linnaeus was a purposefully introduced species, and four megachilid species probably arrived due to human-aided dispersal through maritime activities in the Pacific. The two remaining bee species, an unidentified partial specimen of a halictid bee and the colletid bee <em>Hylaeus (P.) tuamotuensis</em> Michener, are collectively known from only four specimens collected in the 1930s and their provenance is uncertain. French Polynesia therefore comprises a region where recently introduced bee species greatly overwhelm any possible native bee fauna. These introductions are likely to have major ecosystem impacts, including disruptions of existing plant–pollinator networks and facilitating the spread of weedy plant species, as well as positive impacts for agriculture. Future biosecurity initiatives need to consider these potential impacts and the likely routes of dispersal to effectively control any further unintended introductions.</p>

<div class="para">
<p>Using mitochondrial DNA we show that all bee species of the family Apidae in French Polynesia are introduced. Based on our understanding of the remaining known species, this result suggests that bees are not endemic to the island group. This has implications for the genesis of biodiversity on these islands given the importance of bees as pollinators, but these introduced species may be of utility in food production.</p>

<p><i>Aethina tumida</i> is a serious pest of the European honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) in North America and Australia. Here we investigate whether <i>Laccase 2</i>, the phenoloxidase gene essential for cuticle sclerotisation and pigmentation in many insects, and vacuolar<i>-ATPase V-type subunit A,</i> vital for the generation of proton gradients used to drive a range of transport processes<i>,</i> could be potential targets for RNAi-mediated control of <i>A. tumida</i>.</p>

<p>Injection of <i>V-ATPase subunit A</i> (5 ng) and <i>Laccase 2</i> (12.5 ng) dsRNAs resulted in 100% larval mortality, and qPCR confirmed significant decreases and enhanced suppression of transcript levels over time. Oral delivery of <i>V-ATPase subunit A</i> dsRNA in solutions resulted in 50% mortality; however, gene suppression could not be verified. We suggest that the inconsistent RNAi effect was a consequence of dsRNA degradation within the gut owing to the presence of extracellular nucleases.

<item><title>Population structuring of the ubiquitous stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula in southern Brazil as revealed by microsatellite and mitochondrial markers</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p><em>Tetragonisca angustula</em> is one of the most widespread stingless bees in the Neotropics. This species swarms frequently and is extremely successful in urban environments. In addition, it is one of the most popular stingless bee species for beekeeping in Latin America, so nest transportation and trading is common. Nest transportation can change the genetic structure of the host population, reducing inbreeding and increasing homogenization. Here, we evaluate the genetic structure of 17 geographic populations of <em>T. angustula</em> in southern Brazil to quantify the level of genetic differentiation between populations. Analyses were conducted on partially sequenced mitochondrial genes and 11 microsatellite loci of 1002 workers from 457 sites distributed on the mainland and on 3 islands. Our results show that <em>T. angustula</em> populations are highly differentiated as demonstrated by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite markers. Of 73 haplotypes, 67 were population-specific. MtDNA diversity was low in 9 populations but microsatellite diversity was moderate to high in all populations. Microsatellite data suggest 10 genetic clusters and low level of gene flow throughout the studied area. However, physical barriers, such as rivers and mountain ranges, or the presence or absence of forest appear to be unrelated to population clusters. Factors such as low dispersal, different ecological conditions, and isolation by distance are most likely shaping the population structure of this species. Thus far, nest transportation has not influenced the general population structure in the studied area. However, due to the genetic structure we found, we recommend that nest transportation should only occur within and between populations that are genetically similar.</p>

<div class="section" id="ps4356-sec-0001">
<h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
<div class="para" id="ps4356-para-0001">
<p>The chitin synthesis inhibitor novaluron can suppress pests that affect alfalfa seed production, but can negatively affect reproductive success in the alfalfa pollinator <i>Megachile rotundata</i>. Novaluron is considered to be a reduced-risk insecticide because it disrupts ecdysis and is non-lethal to adult insects, but some exposed adults have fewer eggs and suppressed egg hatch. For this experiment, bees nested in field cages where they were exposed to alfalfa that had never been treated with novaluron, alfalfa that had recently been sprayed or alfalfa that had been sprayed 1 and 2 weeks earlier.</p>

<item><title>No evidence that DNA methylation is associated with the regulation of fertility in the adult honey bee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) worker ovary</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Epigenetic modifications, mediated by DNA methylation, are involved in caste differentiation between queen and worker honey bees, <em>Apis mellifera</em>. This study uses methylation sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP) to investigate whether genome-wide DNA methylation is implicated in the regulation of honey bee worker sterility and whether CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis, which suppresses ovary activation in queenless workers, influences DNA methylation. Queenless workers were divided into control and experimental (CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis) cages. We compared MS-AFLP patterns in CO<sub>2</sub>-treated and non-treated workers with and without activated ovaries at 4 h, 2  and 7 days after treatment. While there was evidence of DNA methylation in all samples, there was no detectable difference in genome-wide methylation patterns between any treatment comparisons. This suggests that mechanisms that regulate worker sterility in the adult honey bee worker are not related to genome-wide methylation, and that CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis does not significantly affect DNA methylation patterns in the worker ovary. However, because DNA methylation is sparse in the honey bee, and because MS-AFLP detects only a proportion of methylated sites, it remains possible that a subset of genes that are responsible for the regulation of worker sterility are differentially methylated, but that we failed to pick these up in our genome-wide scan.</p>

<item><title>Potential pollination maintenance by an exotic allodapine bee under climate change scenarios in the Indo-Pacific region</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Recent studies suggest an alarming decline in pollinators across many regions of the world due to multiple factors. One potential factor is climate change, which poses both direct and indirect threats to pollinator populations. To help ameliorate the impact of declining populations on the function of ecological and agricultural systems, there is a need to identify species that may adapt to limit the magnitude of this pollination deficit. The South West Pacific has a highly depauperate endemic bee diversity and numerous non-indigenous species, including honeybees. One allodapine bee, <em>Braunsapis puangensis</em>, has been accidentally introduced to Fiji where it has rapidly spread across multiple islands and become locally abundant. It is a long-tongued bee, unaffected by honeybee pathogens, and has the potential to become an important crop pollinator. Here, we model the distribution of this species under different climate scenarios to determine how it is likely to respond to future climate change. We show that its distribution is unlikely to contract, but potentially expand with climate warming. These scenarios therefore indicate that the plasticity in <em>B.&#160;puangensis</em> populations may allow it to represent an important crop pollinator in this region should honeybee populations decline.</p>

<item><title>Chemical reproductive traits of diploid Bombus terrestris males: Consequences on bumblebee conservation</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>The current bumblebee decline leads to inbreeding in populations that fosters a loss of allelic diversity and diploid male production. As diploid males are viable and their offspring are sterile, bumblebee populations can quickly fall in a vortex of extinction. In this article, we investigate for the first time a potential premating mechanism through a major chemical reproductive trait (male cephalic labial gland secretions) that could prevent monandrous virgin queens from mating with diploid males. We focus our study on the cephalic labial gland secretions of diploid and haploid males of <em>Bombus terrestris</em> (L.). Contrary to initial expectations, our results do not show any significant differentiation of cephalic labial gland secretions between diploid and haploid specimens. Queens seem therefore to be unable to avoid mating with diploid males based on their compositions of cephalic labial gland secretions. This suggests that the vortex of extinction of diploid males could not be stopped through premating avoidance based on the cephalic labial gland secretions but other mechanisms could avoid mating between diploid males and queens.</p>

<item><title>Performance of honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid-treated and untreated cornfields in Quebec</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Twenty-two honeybee (<em>Apis mellifera)</em> colonies were placed in four different cornfield areas in order to study the potential <em>in&#160;situ</em> effects of seed-coated systemic neonicotinoid pesticides used in cornfields (<em>Zea mays</em> spp) on honeybee health. Two apiaries were located in two independent neonicotinoid-treated cornfield areas and two others in two independent untreated cornfield areas used as controls. These experimental hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of one year. Trapped pollen was collected and microscopically identified to define the visited flowers and the amount of corn pollen collected by bees. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was performed to detect pesticide residues in honeybee foragers and trapped pollen. Honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid-treated cornfields expressed significantly higher varroa mite loads than those in untreated cornfields. However, brood production and colony weight were less disturbed by the treatment factor. Sublethal doses of neonicotinoids were detected in the trapped corn pollen and none in bee foragers. Overall, our results show that forager bees collected 20% of corn pollen containing variable concentrations of neonicotinoids. Colonies located in treated cornfields expressed higher varroa loads and long-term mortality than those in untreated cornfields. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed regarding the brood production and colony weight.</p>

The interaction between these environments and the mite <i>Varroa destructor</i> in relation to DWV prevalence, levels, and overt infections, was also analyzed. <i>V. destructor</i> rates were determined, and samples of mites, adult bees, brood parasitized with varroa mites and brood not infested by mites were analyzed. DWV was detected in 100% of the mites and its prevalence and loads in honey bees were significantly higher in colonies from the temperate climate than in colonies from the tropical climate. Significant interactions were found between climate and type of sample, with the highest levels of DWV found in varroa-parasitized brood from temperate climate colonies. Additionally, overt infections were observed only in the temperate climate. <i>Varroa</i> parasitism and DWV loads in bees from colonies with overt infections were significantly higher than in bees from colonies with covert infections. These results suggest that interactions between climate, <i>V. destructor</i>, and possibly other factors, may play a significant role in the prevalence and levels of DWV in honey bee colonies, as well as in the development of overt infections.

<item><title>Vespa velutina nest distribution at a local scale: An 8-year survey of the invasive honeybee predator</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p><em>Vespa velutina</em> is an invasive species that was observed for the first time in France and Europe in 2004, which rapidly threatened domestic honeybees with active predation. For the first time in this study, we analyzed the distribution of <em>V. velutina</em> nests at a local scale to understand the pattern of nesting, and in 8 years of monitoring, a total of 528 nests were surveyed. With the exception of 2 years, the nests of <em>V. velutina</em> were randomly distributed within the monitored area, which suggested that intraspecific competition for nesting sites and/or food was unlikely. When the data for all years were combined, an aggregated distribution of nests at the seafront in the vicinity of the oyster farm and sportfishing activities was observed. This distribution suggested that seafood, attractive to vespids, might provide a valuable alternative food source that favored colony development. We also tested the effect of spring queen trapping of <em>V. velutina</em> on the distribution of nests in 2014, which was the year with the greatest number of colonies within the area; the position of the traps did not influence the distribution of the nests. For the first time, this study showed that (i) intraspecific competition was unlikely to be a mechanism for population regulation, (ii) some areas were more likely favored for hornet nests, and (iii) spring queen wasp trapping was inefficient as a method to limit the distribution of the <em>V. velutina</em> population.</p>

<item><title>Flight range of the Australian stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria (Hymenoptera: Apidae)</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Bees are key pollinators in both natural and agricultural environments throughout the world. Estimates of the typical distance from their nest that bees will fly to forage are useful when planning their deployment in commercial pollination or ecosystem management. Stingless bees (Meliponini) are social bees that live in colonies comprising a queen and many workers. They pollinate several key tropical crops and can be housed and transported in hives. Thus, there is increasing interest in their use as managed pollinators in regions where they occur naturally, including Australia. Here, we use a mark and release method to estimate the homing range of the most commonly propagated species of Australian stingless bee, <em>Tetragonula carbonaria</em> (Smith), where homing range serves as a proxy for foraging flight range. We find the typical and maximum homing range of <em>T. carbonaria</em> to be 333 and 712 m, respectively. This range is less than that of the most commonly used commercial pollinator, the honey bee <em>Apis mellifera</em> Linnaeus, which we argue confers both advantages and disadvantages on <em>T. carbonaria</em> as an alternative crop pollinator.</p>

<item><title>Laboratory rearing of solitary bees and wasps</title><description><h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para">
<p>Ecological experiments often require standardized methods that exclude natural variation and allow manipulation of a single parameter. It has been shown that domesticated honey bee larvae are raisable in a controlled environment. Here we demonstrate that this approach is also transferable to wild solitary bees and wasps without inducing negative effects on their development. Wells may also be supplemented with the antibiotic substance oxytetracycline to control the presence of bacteria. The method thus provides a useful tool to investigate offspring recruitment and larval development in solitary bees and wasps, plus their responses to manipulation of factors as for example diets, toxins and microbiota.</p>
